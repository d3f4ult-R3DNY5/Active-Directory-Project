### Phase 1 : Installation of the Disk Images and Configuring the Server
---
This phase involves the installation and configuration of the ISO images and the server. We will be creating a local domain and a domain administrator account, as well as installing the Windows 11 ISO and configuring a local user account. The Windows 11 installation will use an `unattended XML` file to allow for easier and more consistent configuration.
