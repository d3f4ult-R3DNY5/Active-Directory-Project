# Connecting using the remote registry services

## Overview 
---
When the Remote Registry service is enabled, administrators can remotely access and modify the system registry without needing to log in to the target machine. This allows configuration changes to be performed in the background, often without the user being aware, making it useful for remote administration and troubleshooting tasks.

### Procedure 
---
1. Login in to the system ---> Enable the `Remote Registry Services` and `Remote Access Auto Connection Manager`  on the PC01 ---> Start It
